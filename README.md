Project-Pixel-Art-Maker

A single page app in JavaScript where the user can create artistic designs

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

<h4>What Skills Do I Need?</h4>

  In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills from JavaScript Foundations and Intro to jQuery, including:

- Defining variables with const and let<br/>
- Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object<br/>
- Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners<br/>
- Writing nested loops and using loop variables<br/>

  Although not a requirement, you are encouraged to use <strong>jQuery</strong> to manipulate the DOM for this project.

<h4>How Does This Help My Career?</h4>

  Interacting with the DOM — the structure of a web page — is one of the most fundamental skills for a front-end web developer. Mastering   event listeners is essential to creating user interfaces — and to quite a few other things. Later in the curriculum you'll see much more    about event listeners when you're writing JavaScript code that interacts with the network.
